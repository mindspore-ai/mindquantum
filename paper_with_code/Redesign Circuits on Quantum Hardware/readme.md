# Redesign Quantum Circuits on Quantum Hardware Device

### Abstract

In the process of exploring quantum algorithms, researchers often need to conduct equivalence checking of quantum circuits with different structures or to reconstruct a circuit in a variational manner, aiming to reduce the depth of the target circuit. Whereas the exponential resource overhead for describing quantum systems classically makes the existing methods not amenable to serving large-scale quantum circuits. Grounded in the entangling quantum generative adversarial network
(EQ-GAN), we present in this article a new architecture which enables one to redesign large-scale quantum circuits on quantum hardware. For concreteness, we apply this architecture to three crucial applications in circuit optimization, including the equivalence checking of (non-) parameterized circuits, as well as the variational reconstruction of quantum circuits. The feasibility of our approach is demonstrated by the excellent results of these applications, which are implemented both in classical computers and current NISQ hardware. We believe our work should facilitate the implementation and validation of the advantages of quantum algorithms.
