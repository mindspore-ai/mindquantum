class MQSABRE:
    """
    MQSABRE algorithm for hardware-aware qubit mapping optimization.

    MQSABRE extends the SABRE (SWAP-based BidiREctional heuristic search) algorithm by incorporating
    hardware-specific characteristics into the mapping optimization process. The algorithm performs
    initial mapping and routing optimization in three phases:

    1. Initial mapping: Uses a graph-center-based approach to generate an initial mapping that
       minimizes the average distance between frequently interacting qubits.
    2. Mapping optimization: Employs bidirectional heuristic search with a hardware-aware cost function.
    3. Circuit transformation: Inserts SWAP gates and transforms the circuit to be compatible with
       hardware constraints.

    The algorithm uses a weighted cost function that combines three metrics:
    H = α₁D + α₂K + α₃T
    where:

    - D: Shortest path distance between qubits in the coupling graph
    - K: Error rate metric derived from CNOT and SWAP success rates
    - T: Gate execution time metric considering CNOT and SWAP durations
    - α₁, α₂, α₃: Weight parameters for balancing different optimization objectives

    Args:
        circuit (:class:`~.core.circuit.Circuit`): The quantum circuit to be mapped. Currently only supports
            circuits composed of single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates (including controlled gates).
        topology (:class:`~.device.QubitsTopology`): The hardware qubit topology. Must be a connected
            coupling graph.
        cnoterrorandlength (List[Tuple[Tuple[int, int], List[float]]]): Hardware-specific CNOT characteristics.
            Each entry contains a tuple (i, j) specifying the physical qubit pair in the topology, and a list
            [error_rate, gate_time] where error_rate is the CNOT error rate between qubits i and j (range: [0, 1]),
            and gate_time is the CNOT execution time in arbitrary units.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the topology is not a connected graph.

        Solve the qubit mapping problem using the MQSABRE algorithm.

        The method performs three main steps:
        1. Constructs the distance matrix D using Floyd-Warshall algorithm
        2. Computes hardware-specific matrices K (error rates) and T (gate times)
        3. Performs heuristic search to optimize the mapping while considering the combined cost function

        Args:
            w (float, optional): Look-ahead weight parameter that balances between current and future
                gate operations in the heuristic search. Range: [0, 1].
                When w > 0.5, it favors future operations, potentially reducing circuit depth.
                When w < 0.5, it prioritizes current operations, potentially reducing total gate count.
                Defaults: 0.5.
            alpha1 (float, optional): Weight for the distance metric (D) in the cost function.
                Higher values prioritize minimizing qubit distances. Defaults: 0.3.
            alpha2 (float, optional): Weight for the error rate metric (K).
                Higher values prioritize connections with lower error rates. Defaults: 0.2.
            alpha3 (float, optional): Weight for the gate time metric (T).
                Higher values prioritize faster gate execution paths. Defaults: 0.1.
