# Runs the quantum teleportation protocol.
# The state to be teleported is in qubit 0.
# You can specify that state at the command line by typing
# chp teleport z	  for |0>
# chp teleport Z	  for |1>
# chp teleport x	  for |0>+|1>
# chp teleport X	  for |0>-|1>
# chp teleport y	  for |0>+i|1>
# chp teleport Y	  for |0>-i|1>
# The program first prepares an EPR pair (|00>+|11>) across
# qubits 1 and 2 (1 is Alice's half and 2 is Bob's half).
# Alice then applies the teleportation circuit, and measures
# qubits 0 and 1 to obtain the two-bit error syndrome.  She
# CNOT's this syndrome into qubits 3 and 4, representing
# classical communication to Bob.  Finally, Bob uses the
# syndrome to correct the teleported state, and measures it
# in the standard basis.  When qubit 2 is measured, the
# result should be 0 if the input was z, 1 if the input was
# Z, and random if the input was x, X, y, or Y.
