# Uses Simon's algorithm to learn about the "hidden
# shift" of a function f (the string s such that
# f(x)=f(y) if and only if y=x+s, where + denotes
# bitwise XOR).  The function is the following
# linear map from 5 bits to 4 bits:
# f(a,b,c,d,e)=(a+b,b+c,c+d,d+e)
# Clearly s=11111 for this function.
# The program first prepares a uniform superposition
# over 5-bit strings in qubits 0 to 4.  It then
# computes f in qubits 5 to 8, and measures those
# qubits "for pedagogical purposes."  Finally it
# performs a Fourier transform on qubits 0 to 4 and
# measures them.  The first round of measurements
# should produce a random 4-bit string; the second
# should produce a random 5-bit string y such that
# y*s=0 (that is, y has even parity).
