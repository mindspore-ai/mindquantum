# Encodes a qubit of your choice using the Shor 9-qubit quantum
# error-correcting code, then applies an encoded Pauli operation of
# your choice to the codeword, and finally decodes the codeword and
# measures the result.
# The qubit to be encoded is stored in qubit 0.  Qubit 1 is 1 if and
# only if an X operation should be applied to the codeword, and qubit
# 2 is 1 if and only if a Z should be applied.  So for example, if
# you want to encode |0> and then apply a Y=-iXZ operation, type the
# following at the command line:
# chp qecc9 zZZ
# The output in this case should be |1>.  Or, if you want to encode
# |0>+i|1> and then apply X, type the following:
# chp qecc9 yZz
# The output in this case should be random (since the final state is
# |0>-i|1>).  In general:
# x for |0>
# X for |1>
# y for |0>+i|1>
# Y for |0>-i|1>
# z for |0>+|1>
# Z for |0>-|1>
# Note that since the measurement is in the standard basis, applying
# the Z operator should not have an observable effect.
