# Uses the Bennett-Wiesner dense quantum coding
# protocol to transmit 2 classical bits using 1
# EPR pair and 1 bit of quantum communication.
# You can specify the bits to be transmitted at
# the command line by typing
# chp densecoding zz	for 00
# chp densecoding zZ	for 01
# chp densecoding Zz	for 10
# chp densecoding ZZ	for 11
# These will be stored in qubits 0 and 1.
# The program first prepares an EPR pair across
# qubits 2 and 3 (2 is Alice's half and 3 is Bob's
# half).  Alice then applies unitaries to her half
# of the EPR pair depending on qubits 0 and 1.
# Next, Alice's half is transferred to qubit 4,
# which represents the 1 bit of quantum
# communication to Bob.  Finally, Bob applies
# unitaries to his qubits (4 and 3), and then
# measures them to read Alice's message.
