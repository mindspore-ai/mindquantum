# Runs a GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) experiment:
# Players A, B, and C are given the state
# |000>-|011>-|101>-|110>,
# as well as bits a,b,c (a=b=1 and c=0 in this example).
# Their goal is to output bits x,y,z respectively such
# that x+y+z(mod 2) = a OR b OR c, under the promise that
# a+b+c=0(mod 2).  In contrast to the classical case, there
# exists a quantum strategy that always succeeds: each
# player measures in the standard basis if his bit is 0,
# or in the Hadamard basis if his bit is 1, then outputs
# whatever he observes.  When this program is run, the
# outcomes of the 3 measurements should be uniformly random
# conditioned on having parity=1.
