.. title:: Overview

MindQuantum
===========

MindQuantum is a general quantum computing framework developed by MindSpore and HiQ, that can be used to build and
train different quantum neural networks. Thanks to the powerful algorithm of quantum software group of Huawei and
High-performance automatic differentiation ability of MindSpore, MindQuantum can efficiently handle problems such as
quantum machine learning, quantum chemistry simulation, and quantum optimization, which provides an efficient platform
for researchers, teachers and students to quickly design and verify quantum machine learning algorithms. MindQuantum
