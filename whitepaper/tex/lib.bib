  abstract = {We show that standard multilayer feedforward networks with as few as a single hidden layer and arbitrary bounded and nonconstant activation function are universal approximators with respect to Lp(μ) performance criteria, for arbitrary finite input environment measures μ, provided only that sufficiently many hidden units are available. If the activation function is continuous, bounded and nonconstant, then continuous mappings can be learned uniformly over compact input sets. We also give very general conditions ensuring that networks with sufficiently smooth activation functions are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to a function and its derivatives.}

  abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that each have the potential to alter how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines (SVMs) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of conventional SVMs. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical SVM. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers3 to machine learning.},

  abstract = {Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the physical dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry---calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He--H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

  title     = {Universal quantum state preparation via revised greedy algorithm},
  journal   = {Quantum Science and Technology},
  abstract  = {Preparation of quantum state lies at the heart of quantum information processing. The greedy algorithm provides a potential method to effectively prepare quantum state. However, the standard greedy (SG) algorithm, in general, cannot take the global maxima and instead becomes stuck on a local maxima. Based on the SG algorithm, in this paper we propose a revised version to design dynamic pulses to realize universal quantum state preparation, i.e. preparing an arbitrary state from another arbitrary one. As applications, we implement this scheme to the universal preparation of single- and two-qubit state in the context of semiconductor quantum dots and superconducting circuits. Evaluation results show that our scheme outperforms the alternative numerical optimizations with higher preparation quality while possesses the comparable high efficiency. Compared with the emerging machine learning, it shows better accessibility and does not require any training. Moreover, the numerical results show that the pulse sequences generated by our scheme are robust against various errors and noises. Our scheme opens a new avenue of optimization in few-level system and limited action space quantum control problems.}

  journal   = {Quantum Science and Technology},
  abstract  = {Any quantum program on a realistic quantum device must be compiled into an executable form while taking into account the underlying hardware constraints. Stringent restrictions on architecture and control imposed by physical platforms make this very challenging. In this paper, based on the quantum variational algorithm, we propose a novel scheme to train an Ansatz circuit and realize high-fidelity compilation of a set of universal quantum gates for singlet-triplet qubits in semiconductor double quantum dots, a fairly heavily constrained system. Furthermore, we propose a scalable architecture for a modular implementation of quantum programs in this constrained systems and validate its performance with two representative demonstrations, the Grover’s algorithm for the database searching (static compilation) and a variant of variational quantum eigensolver for the Max-Cut optimization (dynamic compilation). Our methods are potentially applicable to a wide range of physical devices. This work constitutes an important stepping-stone for exploiting the potential for advanced and complicated quantum algorithms on near-term devices.}
