In \MindQuantum, we use \Simulator to simulate quantum state. A \Simulator maintain a quantum state, as mentioned in section \ref{sec:sim_basic_usage}, methods start with `apply' will change this maintained quantum state, and methods start with `get' will not change anything but only extrude information from the quantum state.

Simulating quantum systems imposes high performance requirements on simulators. In \MindQuantum, we utilize C++ or CUDA as the underlying simulator implementation language, accelerating quantum simulations based on different hardware instruction sets. We adopt a policy-based development approach, optimizing the fundamental simulator interface for different instruction sets and encapsulating them into policy types. Building upon a unified quantum simulation framework, we generate different quantum simulators using various simulator policies, such as AVX-supported simulators, neon-supported simulators, and GPU-supported simulators.

The unified simulator layer use different policy to finish circuit simulation and expectation and gradient calculation. The hardware device layer shows we support CPU, GPU and Kunpeng platform.}

Depending on the specific quantum system being simulated, we have the option to choose between a full amplitude quantum simulator or a density matrix simulator. In \MindQuantum, these two simulators are referred to as `mqvector' and `mqmatrix', respectively. In the current \version version, the `mqvector' simulator also supports GPU acceleration and is named `mqvector\_gpu'. Both `mqvector' and `mqmatrix' use same design pattern in Fig.~\ref{4_1_sim_str}. Based on these simulators, noise simulation is also supported with the help of quantum channel, which will talked in section ~\ref{sec:noise_simulation}.
